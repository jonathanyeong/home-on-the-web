A few people that I know have started new jobs. First off, HUGE CONGRATS!!! Starting a job is exciting and daunting, let alone the process of interviewing is unnecessarily stressful. And that got me thinking about my experience with starting at my most recent position. How did I feel when I was starting? What did I do during the first 6 months? If I could go back what would I change? You could call this a retrospective of my onboarding experience.

I've been at my current job for 6 months now. Some days it feels like longer. Other days so much shorter [^1]. I still remember the first day I started, logging onto Google Meet for the first time. Seeing the faces of my onboarding cohort. Trying to adapt to a remote-only world. It was... awkward. But also heartwarming. Because we were all in this awkward situation together. And we made the most of it. In Shopify, we have a month long onboarding about Shopify and the engineering culture before being onboarded onto our various teams. By the time I had started onboarding with my product area, I was pretty hosed with information.

Here's the tips that I would offer
- Start a career document.
	- This document is a place to track your impact. Even though you're just started, it's a place that can be a place to track your progress. I felt that imposter syndrome when I started at Shopify. I know Ruby & Rails but why can't I get this. Maybe it was more to do with so much learning. There was so much context. But having a log where I could track that progress was invaluable. I can go back to it and see what my first PR was.
	- I used Notion for this
- Keep a glossary of terms
	- Even better if this is a public piece of documentation that you can update. Every company has their own terms. User could mean a bunch of different things, to different people, in the **same** company!
	- I used Notion for this
- Set up the codebase using the documentation. By following the steps closely you can see what is missing and contribute to fix it. It's also a resource to point to when you do get stuck. You can say exactly what steps you tried by sending a link to the docs.
- Pair often with different people!
	- The hardest part of coming into a new codebase is gaining context. I've found pairing the best way to do this. You can get insight into decisions made in the codebase much faster.
	- These people can help send you diagrams or other pieces of context that you might not have gotten through the documentation you've been reading.
	- Through pairing you can also observe what other people do. You can see what buttons they click, or what their git workflow is. Emulating what more tenured people do is another way to ramp up quickly. Definitely, question the practices that don't make sense. You don't want to emulate a bad habit. You can also observe how other people solve bugs or interact with other teams.
- Once you've started understanding pieces of the system. Draw out the diagram. Especially, the data flowing through the system. How does a user interact with your system, how does the system respond to this event? Do this first without looking at any documentation or code!
	- When I did this process, I struggled a lot. There were plenty of fuzzy areas of knowledge. Where I really didn't know what was going on. This practice helped highlight what I was missing... I need to do this again!
	- Don't be afraid to get deep! The deeper you get the more you might be lost. But even if you've touched a file, if you or someone runs into a similar problem. You have an idea of where to look. And the next time you can go a little deeper.
- Meet as many people as you can. And if you're remote, be proactive about consistent meetings!
	- This has been the hardest thing to adapt to with remote work. For the first few weeks of joining Shopify, I didn't know who I was working with. I was invited to slack channels but I didn't know if everyone on those channels would be my teammates. That was not the best experience, so set up time with your manager or your onboarding buddy to understand your team. Then meet with those people regularly! Have coffee chats to learn mroe about them, attend social events, or put your hand up to run an event!
- Carve out time to rest, and to learn on your own
	- The problem with onboarding is the pace of it. You're hosed with so much information that a lot of that knowledge drips off you. I.e. you forget it. Take some time to not learn a new feature but instead go back through your own knowledge. Or even take some time away from your company, and focus on learning more about the language you're working with. Something that I wish I set up early on was more focused sessions where I'm developing as a programmer. Not focused on anything work specific. But work adjacent.

That is all. Good day.
